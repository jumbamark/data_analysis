    "- However because the metrics don't show on the same page,figuring out the best movie can get confusing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use a scatter plot\n",
    "- We can start with [Rotten Tomatoes: Top 100 Movies of All Time](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/browse/movies_at_home/critics:certified_fresh?page=1)\n",
    "- We can use a scatter plot to look at auddience scores vs critic scores for each movie\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we put audience scores on the horizontal axis and critic scores on the vertical axis, movies in the top right quadrant are amazing movies with high audience and critic scores\n",
    "- Movies in the bottom right quadrant are critically underrated with high audience scores and low critic scores\n",

    "### Generate a Word Cloud\n",
    "- For lot's of people, Rodger Ebert's movie review was the only review they needed because he explained the movie in such away that they would know whether they would like it or not\n",
    "- Wouldn't it be neat if we had a word cloud for each of the movies in the top 100 list at [RodgerEbert.com](https://www.rogerebert.com/)?\n",
    "- We can use a Andreas Mueller's [Word Cloud Generator in Python](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/) to help.\n",
