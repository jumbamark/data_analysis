    "### Learning About Our Dataset\n",
    "#### Diabetes\n",
    "- Increasing prevelance of diabetes in the 21st century is a problem. Patients have symptoms like;\n",
    "    * unusual thirst\n",
    "    * frequent urination\n",
    "    * extreme fatigue\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diabetes can also lead to more serious complications like stroke, blindness, loss of limbs, kidney failure and even heart attack\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discovery Of Insulin\n",
    "- Insulin was discovered in the 1920s by Frederick Banting\n",
    "- Most of the food we eat is turned in glucose or sugar for our bodies to use for energy. The pancrease, an organ near the stomach makes a hormone called insulin to help glucose get into the cells of our bodies. When you have diabetes the body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use its own insulin as well as it should and it causes the sugars to build up in the body\n",
    "\n",
    "- With the discovery of insulin pharmaceutical companies began its production on a large scale. Although it doesn't cure diabetes, its one of the biggest discoveries in medicine\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges with insulin\n",
    "- Default administration is by needle, multiply times a day. Insulin pumps are a recent invention. They are insulin delivering devices that are semi permanently connected to a diabetics body.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Future: Oral Insulin?\n",
    "- Wouldn't it be great if diabetics could take insulin orally? This is an active area of research but historically the roadblock is getting insulin through the stomach's thick lining\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Dataset: Auralian and Novodra Trials\n",
    "- We willbe looking at the phase 2 clinical trial data of 350 patients for a new innovative oral insulin called Auralian - a propriety capsule that can solve this stomach lining problem \n",
    "\n",
    "- Phase 2 trials are intended to;\n",
    "    * Test the efficacy and the dose response of a drug\n",
    "    * Identify adverse reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this trial half of the pateints are being treated with Auralian and the other 175 being treated with a popular injectible insulin called Novodra\n",
    "- By comparing key metrics between these two drugs, we can determine if Auralin is effective\n",
    "- The most important metric HbA1c levels and specifically HbA1c change. HbA1c is a property of the blood that measures how well your blood sugar levels have been controlled over the past few months with higher levels being bad. If auralin, the new oral insulin can reduce HbA1c levels at a similar standard as the injectable insulin novodra from some standard petrial baseline like say they both decrease HbA1c_levels from `7.9%` to `7.4%`, a `.5%` drop..if we even get a `.4%` drop we've got ourselves a major medical breakthrough in the dramatic quality of life improvement for diabetics all over the world"

    "### Types of Assessment\n",
    "- There are two types or styles of assessing your data; visual and programmatic\n",
    "- __Visual assessment__ is just opening it and looking through the data in its entirety\n",
    "- __Programmatic assesment__ uses code to view specific parts of the data like using functions or methods to summarize the data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Assessing Data\n",
    "- Regardless of the type of assessment, assessing data can be broken into two steps;\n",
    "    * detecting an issue\n",
    "    * documenting that issue\n",
    "\n",
    "- When documenting an issue you don't have to specify how to fix it, which is part of the cleaning step in the data wrangling framework\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation\n",
    "- Why should we first document unclean issues we observe rather than just write what we need to do to fix the issues?\n",
    "- When your data's issues get complicated, writing how to fix each can get confusing, lengthy and time-consuming. It can get overwhelming trying to think of how to clean something complicated immediately after documenting it\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are separating assessing and cleaning steps of the data wrangling process, writing only observations as a first step is good practice\n",
    "- If you choose to assess an issue then immediately clean that issue, you can skip the observation and go straight to defining how to clean it"

    "- Involves looking at your program in its entirety in whatever program you like\n",
    "- Visual assessment can be directed or non directed\n",
    "- **Directed** - means looking through each table within a jupyter notebook or a spreadsheet like Google Sheets or MS Excel. Sometimes pandas is the only option because some datasets are so large that spreadsheet programs crash when trying to open them\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-directed** is when you look at different pieces of tables such as scrolling aimlessly and stumbling upon issues, then dialling in on something once you have more of a clue on what issue you've spotted. At that point you can use pinpointed assesment whether visual or programmatic\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visual assessment is great for getting acquainted with the dataset and just trying to understand what it is all about like acquiring a mental picture of it . Also alot of time assessing is driven by the problem you want to solve like checking the values in the columns and rows you plan on using in your analysis"

    "- **novodra**: same as above, except for patients that continued treatment with Novodra\n",
    "- **hba1c_start**: the patient's HbA1c level at the beginning of the first week of treatment. HbA1c stands for Hemoglobin A1c. The [HbA1c test](https://depts.washington.edu/uwcoe/healthtopics/diabetes.html) measures what the average blood sugar has been over the past three months. It is thus a powerful way to get an overall sense of how well diabetes has been controlled. Everyone with diabetes should have this test 2 to 4 times per year. Measured in %.\n",
    "- **hba1c_end**: the patient's HbA1c level at the end of the last week of treatment\n",
    "- **hba1c_change**: the change in the patient's HbA1c level from the start of treatment to the end, i.e., `hba1c_start` - `hba1c_end`. For Auralin to be deemed effective, it must be \"noninferior\" to Novodra, the current standard for insulin. This \"noninferiority\" is statistically defined as the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval being less than 0.4% for the difference between the mean HbA1c changes for Novodra and Auralin (i.e. Novodra minus Auralin)."

    "- Different programs have different ways of representing data, pandas uses the **object** data type to represent strings. This is different from the categorical data type which is **category** in pandas. The category data type has a limited number of possible values\n",
    "- In the `patients` table, `assigned_sex` and `state` are object types but they should be category because there is a limit range of values for each.\n",
    "- Similarly zip code is `float` but it needs to be a string so it should be an `object` type and `birthdate` should be a `datetime` type\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are also issues inthe `treatments` table for `auralin` and `novodra` columns which should eventually be integers\n",
    "- Data tyes are important to change because there are special calculations you can do and also summaries of the categorical, numerical and even dateetime data types. If they are miscategorized you cant do those calculations or summaries i.e if `birthdate` is kept as `object` instead of `datetime` we cant take advantage of pandas time series or date time functionalities of which there are plenty but simple ones would be calculating age from a certain biirth date\n",

    "- Recall tha `hba1c_change` determines the effectiveness of our insulin. In terms of controlling blood sugar a change of `0.4` is considered a success. So `0.9` is  a really big change that is somewhat implausable especially given that the 75 percentile is at `0.9` too \n",
    "- The gap between 25 and 50 is only `0.04`  while its nearly `0.6` between 50 and 75\n",
    "- If we scroll up to the visual assesment of the treatments table, we'll see that the `hba1c_change` for this `0.97` entry is calculated incorrectly. It should be `0.47`, this is an __accuracy__ issue\n",
    "\n",
    "- This data inaccuracy is important to clean because `hba1c_change` is the key metric for our clinical trial. The deemed success or failure of this oral insulin hinges on this variable\n",
    "\n",
    "#### pandas Sample method\n",
    "- `.sample` returns a random sample of entries from a dataframe\n",
    "- If we inspect the contact column we see there are multiple representations for phone number. This is a consistency error in the data entry"
