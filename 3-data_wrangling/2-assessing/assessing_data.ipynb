    "# Assessing Data\n",
    "- Assessing data is the second step in the data wrangling process. When assessing you're inspecting your data set for two things;\n",
    "    * __Data quality issues__ - Data tha has quality issues have issues with content like missing, duplicate or incorrect data. This is called dirty data\n",
    "    * __Lack of tidiness__ - Data that has specific structural issues that slow you down when cleaning and analyzing, visualizing or modelling your data later\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can search for these issues in two ways; visually by scrolling, programmatically using code\n",

    "#### Diabetes\n",
    "- Increasing prevelance of diabetes in the 21st century is a problem. Patients have symptoms like;\n",
    "    * unusual thirst\n",
    "    * frequent urination\n",
    "    * extreme fatigue\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diabetes can also lead to more serious complications like stroke, blindness, loss of limbs, kidney failure and even heart attack\n",

    "### Discovery Of Insulin\n",
    "- Insulin was discovered in the 1920s by Frederick Banting\n",
    "- Most of the food we eat is turned in glucose or sugar for our bodies to use for energy. The pancrease, an organ near the stomach makes a hormone called insulin to help glucose get into the cells of our bodies. When you have diabetes the body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use its own insulin as well as it should and it causes the sugars to build up in the body\n",
    "\n",
    "- With the discovery of insulin pharmaceutical companies began its production on a large scale. Although it doesn't cure diabetes, its one of the biggest discoveries in medicine\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges with insulin\n",
    "- Default administration is by needle, multiply times a day. Insulin pumps are a recent invention. They are insulin delivering devices that are semi permanently connected to a diabetics body.\n",

    "### The Future: Oral Insulin?\n",
    "- Wouldn't it be great if diabetics could take insulin orally? This is an active area of research but historically the roadblock is getting insulin through the stomach's thick lining\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Dataset: Auralian and Novodra Trials\n",
    "- We willbe looking at the phase 2 clinical trial data of 350 patients for a new innovative oral insulin called Auralian - a propriety capsule that can solve this stomach lining problem \n",
    "\n",
    "- Phase 2 trials are intended to;\n",
    "    * Test the efficacy and the dose response of a drug\n",
    "    * Identify adverse reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this trial half of the pateints are being treated with Auralian and the other 175 being treated with a popular injectible insulin called Novodra\n",
    "- By comparing key metrics between these two drugs, we can determine if Auralin is effective\n",
    "- The most important metric HbA1c levels and specifically HbA1c change. HbA1c is a property of the blood that measures how well your blood sugar levels have been controlled over the past few months with higher levels being bad. If auralin, the new oral insulin can reduce HbA1c levels at a similar standard as the injectable insulin novodra from some standard petrial baseline like say they both decrease HbA1c_levels from `7.9%` to `7.4%`, a `.5%` drop..if we even get a `.4%` drop we've got ourselves a major medical breakthrough in the dramatic quality of life improvement for diabetics all over the world"
