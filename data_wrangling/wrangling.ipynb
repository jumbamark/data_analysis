    "2. Reproducibility - The ability of a process to produce the same results from identical inputs. Someone other than yourself will want to run your analysis later, so make downloading the datasets as easy to that person as possible\n",
    "- Reproducibility is also one of the main principles of [scientific methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#Documentation_and_replication).
