    "    * __Drug Company Scientist__ - If your company is about to start human trials for a life saving new drug and you need to determine the right dosage for humans based on your lab and animal tests, your data needs to be clean or your drug might not work and you could seriously hurt people"

    "1. Scalability - The ability of a process to handle an increasing scope of work. Imsgine you had a thousand files to download on a thousand different web pages instead of just one. It'd take an eternity to point and click a thousand times. You can do the same with a few lines of code\n",
    "2. Reproducibility - The ability of a process to produce the same results from identical inputs. Someone other than yourself will want to run your analysis later, so make downloading the datasets as easy to that person as possible\n",
    "- Reproducibility is also one of the main principles of [scientific methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#Documentation_and_replication). You wanna be able to prove to people that your analysis and visualizations are legitimate plus the dataset on the web page it lives may change"

    "### Intro\n",
    "#### Data Quality\n",
    "- Low quality data is commonly reffered to as dirty data. Dirty data has issues with its content.\n",
    "- Data quality is an assesment or a perception of data's fitness to serve its purpose in a given context\n",
    "- There are no hard and fast rules for data quality. One dataset may be high enough for one application but not for another\n",
    "- Common data quality issuees include;\n",
    "    * missing data\n",
    "    * invalid data - a cell having an impossible value i.e -50 inches as someone's height, having inches in the height column as well as it makes it a string\n",
    "    * inaccurate data\n",
    "    * inconsistent data - i.e using different units for height\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tidiness\n",
    "- Untidy data is commonly referred to as messy data. Messy data has issues with its structure\n",
    "- A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In tidy data;\n",
    "    * Each variable forms a column\n",
    "    * Each observation forms a row\n",
    "    * Each type of observation unit forms a table\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Assesment\n",
    "1. __virtual assesment__ - opening your data in your favourite software application and scroll through it looking for quality and tidiness issues\n",
    "2. __pragmatic assesment__ - tends to be more efficient than visual assesment. One simple example is the pandas `info` method which gives us a basic info of the dataframe like number of entries, number of columns, the types of each column, whether there are missing values and more. Another example is the pandas plotting capabilities through the `plot` method"
