    "- Ipython is what provides the interactive python kernel we use in jupyter notebook\n",
    "- We can use Ipython outside of jupyter notebook with its command line interface in our terminal\n",
    "- This is very convenient and awesome for quick modifications, exploration, experimentation, and even running Python script\n",
    "- [Documentation](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- To use ipython's command line interface just type `ipython` in your terminal. It should work if you have jupyter notebook installed\n",
    "- Just like in jupyter notebook, import packages and use datasets"

    "- If you save your file as `demo.py` you can run it in termianl with `python demo.py`\n",
    "- Ideally, you'd group your analysis into functions and run them in your main function. This helps you organize your code and generalize if possible."
